## Resume review

**100$**

Resumes are the first thing a recruiter sees, and are ultimately the very first point of contact you have with the job pipeline.
It is crucial to have a good resume which exemplifies your current skillset and your fit for the position.

In this thirty minute consultation session, I will review your resume and look for quick wins which can be implemented immediately. 
I will collate a list of potential improvements and things which can be done which might take a bit longer to acquire (such as skills) which will enhance your resume and make you more employable.

## Career Consultation

**Price on inquiry**

The time and services provided by this consultation are flexible. 
We can work on a career plan together over multiple hours, or I can help you develop skills required to get hired.
